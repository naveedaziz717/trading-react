## Setup

```
npm install
npm run launch
```

## Code Examples

All components are functional and written in Typescript:

```javascript
interface CartIconProps {
  toggleCartHidden: (event: any) => void
  itemCount: number
}

export const CartIcon = ({
  toggleCartHidden,
  itemCount
}: CartIconProps): JSX.Element => (
  <div className='cart-icon' onClick={toggleCartHidden}>
    <ShoppingIcon className='shopping-icon'></ShoppingIcon>
    <span className='item-count'>{itemCount}</span>
  </div>
)
```

## Features

- Users can be authenticated using Google Sign-In or by creating a new account
- Cart data persists throughout browser sessions using localStorage
- Payments are handled via external Stripe API
- Clothing/accessory models are stored in Mongo and retrieved dynamically

Considerations for improvement: 

- Expand inventory models with options for stock quantity, size, alt angles
- Save cart persistence on database for logged in users
- Better pop-up messages for error handling

## Status

Project is deployed on Heroku!
